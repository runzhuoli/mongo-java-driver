      <description>POJOs - Plain Old Java Objects The 3.5 release of the driver adds POJO support via the PojoCodec, which allows for direct serialization of POJOs and Java Beans to and from BSON. Internally, each PojoCodec utilizes a ClassModel instance to store metadata about how the POJO should be serialized.
A ClassModel for a POJO includes:
 The class of the POJO. A new instance factory. Handling the creation of new instances of the POJO.</description>

 Ordered bulk operations execute all the operation in order and error out on the first write error.
 Unordered bulk operations execute all the operations and report any the errors.</description>

      <guid>/mongo-java-driver/3.5/driver-async/reference/observables/</guid>
      <description>Observables The MongoDB Async Driver is fully callback-based and makes extensive use of SingleResultCallback&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; to achieve this. The SingleResultCallback&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; interface requires the implementation of a single method onResult(T result, Throwable t) which is called once the operation has completed or errored. The result parameter contains the result of the operation if successful. If the operation failed for any reason then the t contains the Throwable reason for the failure. This pattern allows the users application logic to be deferred until the underlying network IO to MongoDB has been completed.</description>

      <description>Authentication The Java driver supports all MongoDB authentication mechanisms, including those only available in the MongoDB Enterprise Edition.
MongoCredential import com.mongodb.MongoCredential;  An authentication credential is represented as an instance of the MongoCredential class. The MongoCredential class includes static factory methods for each of the supported authentication mechanisms.
To specify a list of these instances, use the MongoClientSettings and pass as a parameter to the MongoClients.create() method.
To specify a single MongoCredential instance, you can also use the ConnectionString and pass to a MongoClients.</description>

      <description>Codec and CodecRegistry In the last section we saw how to use the BsonReader and BsonWriter API to read and write BSON documents. But writing code at that low a level is tedious and error-prone, so in practice these algorithms are packaged in implementations of the Codec interface.
Codec The Codec interface abstracts the processes of decoding a BSON value into a Java object using a BsonReader and encoding a Java object into a BSON value using a BsonWriter.</description>

      <description>Documents The driver includes several classes and interfaces used for representing BSON documents.
BsonDocument Although generally not needed by users of the high-level driver API, the BsonDocument class is central to the way that documents are managed internally by the driver. The BsonDocument class can represent dynamically structured documents of any complexity with a type-safe API. For instance, the document
{ &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;MongoDB&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; : [ 1, 2 ] }  can be constructed as a BsonDocument as follows:</description>

      <description>JSON As discussed earlier, the Java driver supports reading and writing BSON documents represented as JSON values. The driver supports four standard variants:
 Extended Mode: Canonical representation that avoids any loss of BSON type information. See the Extended JSON specification for a description of this mode. Relaxed Mode: Relaxed representation that loses type information for BSON numeric types and uses a more human-readable representation of BSON dates. See the Extended JSON specification for a description of this mode.</description>

However, they are not directly responsible for reading and writing their representations from and to BSON. Instead, this process is delegated to BsonWriter and BsonReader, abstract classes that expose methods for iterative, stream-based processing of BSON documents.
BsonWriter The BsonWriter class exposes methods for writing a BSON document.</description>

A MongoClient instance actually represents a pool of connections to the database; you will only need one instance of class MongoClient even with multiple concurrently executing asynchronous operations.

The driver creates MXBean instances of a single type: ConnectionPoolStatisticsMBean. The driver registers one ConnectionPoolStatisticsMBean instance per each server it connects to. For example, in the case of a replica set, the driver creates an instance per each non-hidden member of the replica set.
Each MXBean instance is required to be registered with a unique object name, which consists of a domain and a set of named properties.</description>
